# Bad Apple World Preset
This mod adds in two new world presets, both of which generate a random world with the frames of the Bad Apple!! video in the world. All the biomes are random, but the areas where terrain meet water are set. To use, simply install the mod, create a new world, *and wait for the screen to load*, and then toggle the World Presets until you find the Bad Apple!! ones.

# Important Disclaimer: Performance!
If you have a lower-end PC, loading the world creation screen may freeze or take a while to load. If it wasn't obvious, loading that much data is taxing. The world generation performance shouldn't be that bad though, but be advised. This project is mainly for fun, but I have decided to release it due to popular demand.

## World Generation Changes:
To make it work properly for the video, and for performance, some changes had to be made.  

**Global Changes**
- Stopped Carver Cave generation (this happens in other presets too! Beware)  

**Both Presets**
- No Noise Caves generate
- Depth biome parameter handled differently
- No aquifers generate   

**Video Version Only**
- Rivers, "Peak" Biomes, and Mushroom Islands do not generate
- 42 blank frames at the beginning don't generate
- Biomes at 100x scale
